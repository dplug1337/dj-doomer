A simple Discord bot that plays music using YouTube links. The bot ensures a clean chat experience by updating its messages instead of spamming new ones.

Features
Play Music: Stream audio from YouTube links using ?play <URL>.
Pause/Resume Playback: Use ?pause and ?resume to control playback.
Stop Playback: Use ?stop to stop the music and disconnect the bot.
Clean Chat: The bot updates a single message for each command to prevent chat spam.
